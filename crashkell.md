# Chapter: Strings

```haskell
"All about strings!
```

```why
Strings must be quoted with an open and close quote.
```

## Exercise: "Hello World"

```haskell
prinp "Hello Sworld"
```

```why
You can print anything showable to STDOUT using the "print" function.
```

## Exercise: Quoth the Raven

```haskell
'Nevermore'
```

```why
Strings must be quoted with double-quotes.
```

## Exercise: Parens

```haskell
(print "Hi!"))
```

## Exercise: Combining Strings

```haskell
print "Hello" ++ "World"
```

```why
Parenthesise your constructed string.
```

<!--
## Exercise: Variables

```haskell
let
		h = "Hello"
		W = "World"
		p = h ++ " " ++ w
	in print p
```
-->

# Chapter: Booleans

```haskell
if true then 1 else 2
```

```why
Booleans True and False start with capital letters.
```

## Exercise: Equality

```haskell
1 + 1 == "Two"
```

```why
Only things of the same type can be compared for equality.

For example: Two numbers, two strings, etc.
```


# Chapter: Lists

```haskell
[1,2,3
```

```why
Use balanced square braces to construct lists!
```


## Exercise: Explicit Constructors

```haskell
1:2:3:[] == [1,2,3]
```

```haskell
let (_:x:y:_) = [1..100] in [y,y,y,x]
```

## Exercise: Enumerations

```haskell
[1,2,3,4,5,6] == [1..6]
```

```haskell
[1..6] == enumFromTo 1 6
```

## Exercise: Zipping

```haskell
[5,7,9] == zipWith (+) [1..3] [4..6]
```

# Chapter: Tuples

```haskell
let (a,b) = (1,2,3) in a * 2 + b * 3
```

# Chapter: Numbers

```haskell
1 ? 1 == 2
```

```why
You can combine numbers with the usual arithmatic operations such as +, *, etc.
```

## Exercise: Multiplication

```haskell
let x@(7,10,10) = (2 * 2 + 3, 3 + 2 * 2, (3 + 2) * 2) in x
```

```why
BFIMDAS precendence is followed. Use parens for specific groupings.

Brackets
Functions
Indices
Multiplication
Division
Addition
Subtraction
```

# Chapter: Lists

```haskell
product (1,2,3)
```

```why
The product function takes a list.
Lists are written using square brackets.
```

## Exercise: Ranges

```haskell
[10..1]
```

## Exercise: Mapping

```haskell
map succ [1..10]
```

# Chapter: Lambdas

```haskell
map (\x -> x+1) [1..10]
```
